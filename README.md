# Vala in Che
Hello,
this is a first try to have Vala language support in Che
- compilation with a container + valac installed
- running the gtk app in the browser with broadwayd
- code completion and syntax highlighting for vala files

Try it: https://che.openshift.io/factory?url=https://github.com/sunix/vala-language-server-container
